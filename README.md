# Agentic Image Personality

**Agentic Image Personality** is an AI-powered FastAPI application that analyzes an uploaded image (such as a selfie) and generates a personalized, culturally-aware, and witty response based on both the image and a brief user personality description. The project leverages Google Gemini (Generative AI) models for vision and text, and supports playful, context-rich personas.

## Features

- **Image Analysis:** Uses Google Gemini vision models to describe and interpret uploaded images.
- **Personality Profiling:** Summarizes user-provided personality traits into concise core attributes.
- **Persona-based Responses:** Generates final responses using custom bot personas (e.g., witty Mexican chatbot, Delhi mentor, Parisian friend, etc.), blending image context and user personality.
- **Cultural Awareness:** Bots can recognize and comment on cultural elements in images, and adapt their tone and slang accordingly.
- **API & Notebook:** Includes a FastAPI backend for production and a Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation.
